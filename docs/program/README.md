# Program Governance Overview

This directory captures the governance data required by `.agents/rules/base.md`. The structure mirrors the workflow described in the rules:

- `programs/`: high-level program definitions (vision, scope, cadence).
- `milestones/`: active milestones with objective, scope, due date, and issue tracking.
- `status.md`: current board snapshot summarising progress and risks.
- `releases.md`: release train overview and current timeline.

All files are lightweight Markdown so they can be kept in sync with the issue tracker.
