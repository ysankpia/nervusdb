| #35   | [epic] native temporal core                         | ✅ converted to epic, tracking child issues | split into #38–#41                   |
| #38   | feat(core): add temporal episode/fact storage       | ✅ merged (#42)                             | TemporalStore JSON prototype in Rust |

| #40   | refactor(ts): rewire temporal memory to native core | ⏳ open                                     | next action – swap TS bindings       |
| #41   | docs/chore: native temporal migration guide         | ⏳ open                                     | document upgrade path                |

## Next Actions

1. Complete Issue #40 to route `db.memory` through the native pipeline.
2. Draft migration & docs updates (#41) once TypeScript switch lands.
3. Re-run `pnpm bench:temporal` against native path and attach results to docs/benchmarks.

## Risks / Mitigations

- **Parity gaps**: until TypeScript switches to native path, keep the JSON store as a fallback behind feature flag.
- **Migration**: plan conversion script for existing `.temporal.json` data once native persistence is ready.
