# Milestone: v0.6.0 – Native Temporal Core

- **Due date**: 2026-05-31
- **Goal**: migrate temporal memory from the TypeScript JSON prototype to the Rust `nervusdb_core` + napi layer.
- **Status**: in progress

## Next Actions

1. Extend native binding with temporal write helpers and update TS store to prefer native (#40).
2. Add Vitest parity suite verifying native vs JSON results to unblock closing #39/#40.
3. Draft migration/benchmark docs once native path is default and fallback validated (#41).

## Risks / Mitigations

- **Parity gaps**: until TypeScript switches to native path, keep the JSON store as a fallback behind feature flag.
- **Migration**: plan conversion script for existing `.temporal.json` data once native persistence is ready.
- **Addon availability**: ensure loader handles missing native builds gracefully (CI, Windows).
