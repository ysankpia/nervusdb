## Neo4j

- Status: **pending-manual**
- Note: Docker-backed compare harness scaffold is in place; load/query commands are pending incremental hardening.

## Memgraph

## Next Actions

1. Add deterministic import dataset generation.
2. Add unified query set (1-hop/2-hop/aggregation/path).
3. Capture memory and P95/P99 latency in JSON artifacts.
